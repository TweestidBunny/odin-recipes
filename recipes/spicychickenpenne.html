        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Fill a large pot with lightly salted water and brin to a rolling boil. Stir in penne
            and return to a boil. Cook pasta uncovered, stirring occasionally, until tender yet
            firm to the bite, about 11 minutes.
          </li>
          <li>
            Meanwhile, in a deep cast iron skillet, melt butter over medium heat. Sprinkle
            chicken with <sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub> teaspoon Italian seasoning and <sup>1</sup>/<sub>4</sub> teaspoon
            salt.
            Set
            remaining seasoning aside.
          </li>
          <li>
            Add chicken to the skillet. Cook until chicken is no longer pink in the center and
            the juices run clear, about 5 minutes per side. An instant-read thermometer
            inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).
            Remove chicken to a cutting board; keep warm.
          </li>
          <li>
            Slice chicken into thin strips; and add to the skillet. Drain pasta; reserving <sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub>
            cup pasta water.
          </li>
          <li>
            Add the pasta to the skillet. Toss to combine. If sauce seems too thick, add in
            pasta water 1 tablespoon at a time until desired consistency is reached. Sprinkle
            penne with julienned basil. Serve immediately.
          </li>
