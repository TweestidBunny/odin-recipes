        Toss shrimp with salt and pepper in a large bowl until well combined. Heat a
        large high-sided skillet over medium heat. Add 1 tablespoon butter and 1
        tablespoon sun-dried tomato oil; heat until shimmering, about 2 minutes. Add
        shrimp in an even layer, and cook until opaque and pink, 3 to 4 minutes, flipping
        shrimp halfway through cooking time. Transfer shrimp to a large plate.

        Melt remaining 1 tablespoon butter with remaining 1 tablespoon sun-dried
        tomato oil in the same skillet; stir in cherry tomatoes, shallot, garlic, and sun-
        dried tomatoes. Cook, stirring occasionally, until tomatoes are soft and shoot is
        translucent, about 4 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Stir spinach, basil, wine, lemon zest, and crushed red pepper into mixture in
        skillet; cook over medium, scraping up any browned bits from bottom of skillet,
        until wine mixture is reduced by half, about 2 minutes. Stir in heavy cream.
        Reduce heat to low, and add Parmesan cheese; cook, stirring constantly, until
        mixture is slightly thickened and simmering, about 2 minutes. Remove from heat.
      </li>

        Stir in lemon juice; add cooked shrimp along with any juices from plate. Garnish
        with additional basil and Parmesan cheese.
